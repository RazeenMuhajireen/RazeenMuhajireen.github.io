    </div>

    <div class="project-description">
      <p>As a dedicated member of a dynamic team, I played a vital role in the Livestock Monitoring Project, which aimed to revolutionize cattle management through data collection, analysis, and model development. Our comprehensive tech stack, cutting-edge data processing techniques, and results-driven achievements have made a significant impact on the efficiency and decision-making within the livestock industry.</p>
    </div>
    <ul>
    <li>Improved Livestock Management: By harnessing real-time data on cattle location, temperature, and heart rate, our project facilitated more effective livestock management practices, leading to better health and well-being of the cattle.</li>

    <li>Informed Business Decisions: The clean and processed data served as a foundation for informed business decisions, optimizing feed allocation, paddock rotation, and resource utilization.</li>

    <li>Enhanced Operational Efficiency: Our behavior understanding model significantly improved the efficiency of monitoring cattle behavior in remote paddocks, enabling proactive interventions when necessary.</li>

    <li>Increased Business Value: The data-driven insights and efficient data processing contributed to increased business value, enhancing the livestock industry's overall productivity and profitability.</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="project-description">
      Data Collection and Analysis:
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Collaborated with the team to collect real-time cattle data, including GPS location, temperature, and heart rate. The data was obtained from multiple cattle tags attached to the ear, ensuring accurate and consistent information.</li>

      <li>Led the Base Station team responsible for efficiently gathering, cleaning, and processing the vast volume of cattle data. Our meticulous data handling procedures ensured high-quality data for informed decision-making.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="project-description">
      Model Development for Behavior Understanding:
    </div>
    <ul>
    <li>Actively contributed to the development of an innovative cattle behavior model. This model aimed to analyze sitting and standing patterns in paddocks, offering valuable insights into cattle behavior in areas that were not always readily accessible.</li>
    </ul>


    <div class="project-description">
      Tech Stack:
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li>Linux: Employed Linux for its robust and reliable performance, ensuring seamless data handling and processing.</li>

    <li>PostgreSQL: Leveraged PostgreSQL as the primary database technology for efficiently storing and managing the cattle data collected from various tags.</li>

    <li>Movidius, Beaglebone, Raspberry Pi, ESP8266, ESP32: Skillfully integrated these cutting-edge technologies into the system to facilitate real-time data collection and communication with cattle tags.</li>

    <li>Python Scripts and Linux Automation: Developed Python scripts for automating data processing tasks, streamlining workflows, and ensuring the accuracy of data analysis.</li>

    <li>R and Python for Data Processing: Utilized R and Python programming languages for in-depth data analysis and deriving meaningful insights from the collected cattle data.</li>

    <li>Power BI and Excel: Created insightful visualizations using Power BI and Excel, providing stakeholders with intuitive and actionable information.</li>
    </ul>
