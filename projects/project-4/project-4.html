    <span class="lb">Being a Sprinter for over 10 years of my swimming journey, stroke count played a major role in my competitions.

What is a stroke count in swimming?

One stroke is a full arm cycle. In other words, count “one” when the right arm goes in and then “two” when the left arm goes in, and so on.

“The East Germans first used biomechanics. This meant that rather than guessing about technique and form, they could apply changes to athletic performance based on science.” -Bill Toomey

In swimming, proper biomechanics are essential for success. Biomechanical factors for swimming are numerous, but one of the main variable for a meaningful analysis is the stroke rate. It is well-accepted sprinters have a higher stroke rate. The vast majority of elite competitive swimmers knows how many strokes they take at varying speeds. They know that at cruising speed they take 20 strokes per 50m. And that at sprint speed they take 36. Knowing these details in practice helps to avoid over-gliding in races which makes efficient sprinting.

Lower stroke frequency helps you to maintain a lower muscle stiffness as well as increase the ability to store and release energy production when required during the race. This is called efficient swimming.

But tracking the stroke count is one of the major challenges faced by elite swimmers.

Here is my way of tracking the stroke count with the help of machine learning and video analytic.
