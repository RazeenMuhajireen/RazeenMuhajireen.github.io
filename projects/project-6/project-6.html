    <h1>Automated Fish Feeder</h1>

     <div class="project-description">
      <p>At present, there are quite a number of fish feeders available in the aquarium market. These are called automatic fish feeders, which is a device that could be used to automatically feed the fish in a predetermined time. In a technical way, it is to control the fish feeding activity by using a fish feeder that consist of a mechanical system and an electrical system to form a device instead of manually feeding the fish by hand. This device is suitable for fish keepers who sometimes tend to forget to feed the fish as well as who are away from home for a long time. In fact, I too wanted to purchase one of these automatic fish feeders which would solve the problem of feeding my fish when I am away from home for days.</p>
      <p>Looking at automatic fish feeders available in the market, I felt that none of these products will satisfy my growing requirements and be able to customize. I wanted a device that could work as an agent where communication to the device is possible remotely. My growing requirements needed a device that could remotely control the feeding of the fish and also give updates of the feeding, remotely control the temperature as well as lighting, give updates of the water quality as well as water level and also in future to see my tank remotely which would be useful to monitor the health of the fish. So, I decided to make my own device that is capable of handling all these variables.</p>
      <p>I chose ESP32 micro-controller along with a SIM800L GSM module which could establish the connectivity using WiFi, Bluetooth, GPRS or GSM. The reason i chose this combination is to have a stable connection to the device at all times. I purchased a servo motor to achieve the mechanical function of feeding the fish. I also got an OLED display to show the status of the system.</p>
      <p>As a start, I wanted to immediately fix the fish feeding mechanism since I was travelling away for the weekend. I integrated the components and tested the function of remotely feeding the fish. The following video demonstration shows how it works. My next weekend project is to integrate more GPIOs from the ESP32 to control and monitor the above mentioned variables of my aquarium.</p>
